// PreToolUse guard for the sub-agents in `.claude/agents/`.
//
// It enforces exactly two rules, and both are **irreversible at the step**: once `schema-auditor`
// reaches a database or `atomic-commit` writes git history, no later check can undo it. That is the
// whole test for whether a rule belongs here.
//
// Rules about the *end state* — "this agent left product code modified" — are deliberately NOT
// here. Both shapes were built and removed. A step-level path rule blocked `test-writer` from
// mutating product code to watch a test fail, which is the only way to prove a test discriminates,
// while leaving the same write through Bash untouched. A `SubagentStop` end-state check fixed that
// but mitigated a hazard that only exists because two sessions share one working tree — and a
// worktree per session dissolves it instead, for free.
// See tasks/decisions/2026-08-31-worktrees-are-free-and-the-guard-was-the-wrong-layer.md.
//
// **There is no shell-command fence here any more (removed 2026-09-05).**
// ~520 lines parsed command strings with regexes to block `git reset --hard`, `rm -rf` and
// production database writes. It was hardened five times and the defect rate never fell:
// 8 of 9 crafted probes wrong, then 12 and 14 from two independent passes. Replayed over all
// 5,028 commands in this project's transcripts it denied 151, roughly 85 of them legitimate
// work. Root cause of every defect: it parsed shell without a shell parser. It is replaced by
// `permissions.deny` in `.claude/settings.json`, which the harness enforces.
// See `docs/tasks/TARGET_AGENT_GUARDRAILS.md` and
// `tasks/decisions/2026-09-05-first-party-permissions-replace-the-hand-rolled-fence.md`.
//
// It briefly survived here for the two sub-agents alone, wired through their frontmatter, on a
// defence-in-depth argument. That was incoherent — the same parser, the same defect rate, applied
// to whoever happened not to be the main conversation — and it was removed on the human's call.
// **Do not revive it.** `permissions` rules are prefix-matched, so `cd x && git reset --hard` is
// not caught; the twelve shapes that escape are enumerated in `tests/unit/agentGuard.test.ts` as a
// ledger. If one of them must actually be blocked, that is a narrowly-scoped hook for one shape,
// with a corpus replay before it is armed — not this file again.
//
// **Two wirings, deliberately different.**
//   - Agent frontmatter (`schema-auditor`, `atomic-commit`): `PreToolUse`, binds those two agents.
//   - `.claude/settings.json`: `PostToolUse`, binds every session, for the drift log only.
//
// Consequence for the liveness protocol: the log fills with `main` lines from ordinary work, so
// "a line exists" no longer means "an agent ran". Grep for the agent name —
// `grep -E ' (schema-auditor|atomic-commit) ' <log>` — which is what
// `tasks/open/matcherless-hook-wiring-unverified.md` needs.
//
// `jq` is not installed on this machine; node is, and this is a node project, so node it is.
//
// Liveness: every invocation appends to <tmp>/claude-agent-guard.log. Frontmatter hooks come from
// the agent definition as it stood when the SESSION started, so a hook wired mid-session never
// fires, and a silent no-op looks exactly like a working guard
// (tasks/decisions/2026-08-31-agent-definitions-are-session-start-snapshots.md). The log is how you
// tell the difference:
//     cat "$TMPDIR/claude-agent-guard.log"    (Windows: %TEMP%\claude-agent-guard.log)
// No line after `schema-auditor` or `atomic-commit` has run means the hook never fired and the
// contract is still prose.
