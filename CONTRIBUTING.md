# Contributing to Pet Shelter

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Hope for Strays pet shelter platform! This guide explains how to set up your environment, submit changes, and maintain code quality.

---

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment. All contributors are expected to treat each other with respect and kindness. Please report any unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Then clone your fork locally:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/pet-shelter.git
cd pet-shelter

# Add upstream remote to stay synced with main repo
git remote add upstream https://github.com/fergeley/pet-shelter.git
```

### 2. Set Up Local Environment

Follow the setup guide in [`SETUP_AND_INSTALL.md`](SETUP_AND_INSTALL.md):

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# ... fill in .env.local with your database & API keys ...
npm run db:push
npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

### 3. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/image-upload` — new feature
- `fix/login-bug` — bug fix
- `docs/update-readme` — documentation
- `refactor/auth-system` — code refactoring

---

## Development Workflow

### Writing Code

1. **Follow the architecture patterns** in [`documents/ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md`](documents/ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md):
   - Use server actions for data mutations
   - Validate all inputs with Zod
   - Use the FSM pattern for state transitions
   - Implement RBAC guards for authorization

2. **Match the design system** in [`documents/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`](documents/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md):
   - Use theme tokens from CSS variables
   - Apply consistent border radius (squircle style)
   - Keep the warm, approachable brand palette

3. **Write tests first** (TDD):
   ```bash
   npm run test:watch
   ```
   - Unit tests live in `tests/unit/`
   - Test file naming: `{feature}.test.ts`
   - Aim for high coverage, especially for critical paths

4. **Type safety**:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```
   All TypeScript must compile without errors.

5. **Code quality**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint -- --fix
   ```
   ESLint and Prettier will auto-format your code.

### Database Changes

If your feature requires schema changes:

1. Edit `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Sync to database:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```
3. Regenerate types:
   ```bash
   npm run db:generate
   ```
4. Update seed data in `prisma/seed.ts` if needed

### Commit Guidelines

Use **atomic commits** with clear, descriptive messages:

```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "feat: add image upload component for pet listings"
git commit -m "fix: resolve race condition in application status update"
git commit -m "docs: document brand color palette and shape language"

# Poor commit messages
git commit -m "updates"
git commit -m "fix stuff"
git commit -m "WIP"
```

Follow conventional commit format:
- `feat:` — new feature
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `docs:` — documentation
- `refactor:` — code restructuring (no behavior change)
- `test:` — test updates
- `chore:` — dependency, config, build updates

---

## Before Submitting a Pull Request

### 1. Run All Checks

```bash
# Lint code
npm run lint -- --fix

# Type-check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Run tests
npm test

# Build
npm run build
```

All checks must pass before opening a PR.

### 2. Sync with Main Branch

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

If there are conflicts, resolve them and continue:
```bash
git rebase --continue
```

### 3. Force-Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name --force-with-lease
```

---

## Submitting a Pull Request

### PR Title

Use the same format as commit messages:
- `feat: add image upload for pet listings`
- `fix: resolve race condition in applications`
- `docs: add deployment guide`

### PR Description

Include:
1. **What does this PR do?** (1-2 sentences)
2. **Why is this change needed?** (context & motivation)
3. **How does it work?** (brief technical summary)
4. **Testing**: How to verify the changes work
5. **Breaking changes?** (if any)
6. **Related issues** (if applicable, e.g., `Closes #42`)

Example:
```markdown
## What
Implements image drag-and-drop uploader for pet listings.

## Why
Currently, admins must manually enter image URLs. This feature allows direct file uploads with preview.

## How
- New component: `src/components/admin/ImageUpload.tsx` (React dropzone)
- New API route: `src/app/api/upload/route.ts` (storage backend)
- Integrates with `PetFormDialog` to replace URL inputs

## Testing
1. Navigate to `/admin/pets/new`
2. Drag images onto the upload zone
3. Verify preview displays and submit form saves image URLs

## Related
Closes #18 — "Add media upload feature"
```

### PR Checklist

## Code Review Process

### What to Expect

1. **Automated checks** run first (linting, type-checking, tests)
2. **Maintainers** review the code for:
   - Architectural alignment
   - Security & performance
   - Test coverage
   - Design system consistency
   - Documentation quality
3. **Feedback** is provided as comments on specific lines
4. **Your response**: Discuss or implement suggestions
5. **Approval & merge**: Once all feedback is addressed

### How to Respond to Review

- Address all feedback comments (reply or implement changes)
- Push new commits to the same branch
- Request re-review after addressing feedback
- Polite disagreement is okay—explain your reasoning clearly

---

## Common Patterns & Anti-Patterns

### ✅ Do

- Use server actions for mutations: `"use server"` at top of file
- Validate inputs with Zod at the perimeter
- Use declarative RBAC guards: `assertAuthorized(user, ["ADMIN"])`
- Keep state centralized (single source of truth)
- Use the design system tokens for colors, spacing, radius
- Write tests for critical business logic
- Keep commits small and atomic

### ❌ Don't

- Store secrets in `.env.local` then commit it (use `.env.example` instead)
- Make multiple unrelated changes in one commit
- Skip tests "just this once"
- Use hardcoded color values (use CSS variables & Tailwind tokens)
- Introduce new third-party dependencies without discussion
- Leave `console.log()` or `debugger;` statements in production code
- Break the RBAC model or FSM patterns

---

## Running Tests Locally

### Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all tests once
npm test

# Run in watch mode (re-run on file change)
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

Tests live in `tests/unit/` and use Vitest + @testing-library.

### E2E Tests (Future)

When E2E tests are implemented:

```bash
npx playwright test
```
