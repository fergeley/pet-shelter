-- Pet birth date, CONTRACT half: archive `pets.age` and `pets.ageCategory`, then drop them.
--
-- **Run `20260922_pets_birth_date/migration.sql` first, and leave time between the two.**
-- That file is the expand half: it adds `birthDate` / `birthDateIsEstimate`, backfills every row
-- from that row's own intake date and age prose, and relaxes the two old columns to nullable
-- without destroying anything. This file is the other half of that pair and does the destroying.
--
-- Why the pair, rather than one file that does both. The expand half is what stops the outage:
-- production has no `birthDate`, the deployed client selects it on every catalogue read
-- (`getServerPetsAsync`, src/lib/server/petRepository.ts:64, passes no `select`), so every read
-- raises 42703, `handlePersistenceError(…, "read")` swallows it, and the live site serves
-- `src/data/pets.json`. Expand fixes that and is reversible with no data loss. Dropping the two
-- columns fixes nothing further — it only removes the drift and the last copy of the operator's
-- age prose. There is no reason for those to happen in the same minute, and one good reason not
-- to: between them, someone can read the derived birthdays against the prose that produced them,
-- in production, with both still present. That window is the whole point. Use it.
--
-- **This file deliberately does not derive anything.** An earlier revision carried its own
-- backfill, which meant two files in this repo each owned a rule for turning "2 years" into a
-- date — and they disagreed, because the expand half clamps a month-end subtraction
-- (2026-03-31 minus one month is 2026-02-28) where this one's JavaScript-shaped arithmetic rolled
-- it forward to 2026-03-03. Measured, not assumed: three of five test rows differed. Two rules for
-- one conversion is the defect `AGENTS.md` names under "Boundaries and duplication", so this half
-- no longer has one. The expand half owns the arithmetic; this half owns the archive and the drop.
--
-- How it knows expand actually ran, without re-deriving anything to check:
--
--   * Expand ends with `ALTER COLUMN "age" DROP NOT NULL`, so after it, `pets.age` is NULLABLE.
--   * A hand-patched `ALTER TABLE pets ADD COLUMN "birthDate" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '2024-01-01'`
--     — the obvious emergency move to stop the read storm, and `db push`'s own statement with the
--     drops left off — leaves `age` exactly as it was: NOT NULL.
--
-- So "birthDate exists AND age is nullable" means expand ran, and "birthDate exists AND age is
-- still NOT NULL" means someone patched the column in by hand and those dates are very likely all
-- '2024-01-01'. This file proceeds on the first and refuses on the second, naming what to do. That
-- discriminator is structural and costs one catalog lookup; the earlier version tried to tell the
-- two apart by re-deriving every row, which is what forced the duplicate rule in the first place.
--
-- Reversibility. `DROP COLUMN` is a one-way door and `birthDate` cannot reconstruct an operator's
-- free-text "2 years" or their hand-picked band, so both columns are copied to
-- "public"."pets_age_archive_20260922" first, together with each row's `birthDate` and
-- `birthDateIsEstimate` as they stand. `rollback.sql` restores from it verbatim and aborts if
-- `cleanup.sql` has already dropped it. This half's rollback does NOT remove `birthDate` — undoing
-- the expand is the expand's own rollback, and doing it here would put the site back on fixtures.
--
-- The archive is a table `prisma/schema.prisma` does not declare, so until `cleanup.sql` drops it
-- `npm run db:check-drift` reports one extra destructive statement,
-- `DROP TABLE "pets_age_archive_20260922"`. That is expected, and it is the price of a rollback
-- that can restore the original prose. Drift reaches zero when cleanup runs, not before.
--
-- Safety:
--   * One transaction. Any failure leaves `age`, `ageCategory` and the archive as they were.
--   * Nothing is coerced, nothing is guessed, and no value is computed from another.
--   * Safe to re-run: a table with no `age` and a present `birthDate` is a no-op, and the archive
--     insert is ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING.
--   * Takes the same advisory lock key as every other manual migration here — but only when the
--     file runs as ONE transaction. `pg_advisory_xact_lock` is released when its own statement's
--     transaction commits, so an editor running statements separately holds nothing by the time
--     the ALTERs run. The 5-second `lock_timeout` does survive that mode, because it is set inside
--     the DO block. Paste the whole file at once.
--   * Every table is schema-qualified, so the result does not depend on search_path.
--
-- Apply: read the window first. This is the query the soak exists for, and it stops working the
-- moment this file runs:
--
--   SELECT "id", "name", "age", "ageCategory", "intakeDate", "birthDate", "birthDateIsEstimate"
--     FROM pets ORDER BY "birthDate";
--
-- Look for a birthday that disagrees with the prose beside it. Then paste this whole file into the
-- Neon SQL editor for the production branch. After:
--
--   SELECT count(*) AS archived,
--          count(*) FILTER (WHERE NOT "derivedIsEstimate") AS known_birthdays
--     FROM pets_age_archive_20260922;
--   SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
--    WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='pets' AND column_name IN ('age','ageCategory');
--
-- The second returns no rows. Undo: rollback.sql. Drop the archive: cleanup.sql.
--
-- Rehearsed with `rehearse.mjs` beside this file — `npx tsx
-- prisma/migrations/manual/20260922_pets_birth_date_contract/rehearse.mjs`. It runs the real
-- expand file when it is present in the tree, and otherwise builds the post-expand shape directly;
-- the contract's correctness does not depend on expand's arithmetic, which is the point of the
-- split. Not rehearsed: production's actual rows, and any view or constraint there referencing
-- `age`. Either aborts the transaction rather than damaging anything.
