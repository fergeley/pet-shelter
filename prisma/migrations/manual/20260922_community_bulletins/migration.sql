-- Community bulletins: three enums, the `bulletins` table, one index.
--
-- Applied with `npm run db:migrate:bulletins`, which runs this file and then
-- INSERTS src/data/bulletins.json, leaving any row that already exists alone —
-- a re-run cannot revert a notice staff have edited. Written by hand rather than
-- applied with
-- `prisma db push` for the reason 20260903_faq_knowledge_base/migration.sql
-- gives, and for one more that is specific to today:
--
--   `npm run db:push` against this database is CURRENTLY DESTRUCTIVE and
--   unrelated to this change. tasks/open/production-schema-has-drifted-ahead-of-master.md
--   records three destructive statements standing between master's schema and the
--   production branch — the `ApplicationStatus` conversion and the
--   `pets.age` -> `birthDate` migration, both of which lose data. A whole-schema
--   reconciliation run to add bulletins would execute those too. Run
--   `npm run db:check-drift` to see the current gap before touching any of this.
--
-- This file is PURELY ADDITIVE. It creates objects that do not exist on the
-- production branch and alters nothing that does, so it cannot participate in
-- that drift either way.
--
-- Safe to re-run, and safe to run while another worktree applies its own
-- migration:
--
--   * The advisory lock serialises concurrent appliers, and takes the SAME key
--     as the other hand-written migrations in this directory so they queue
--     instead of racing. (Prisma Migrate uses its own key, 72707369.)
--   * Each enum is created optimistically and the duplicate is swallowed. An
--     `IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT FROM pg_type)` pre-check is NOT race-safe: two
--     sessions can both pass the check and the loser then errors.
--   * BEGIN/COMMIT live in this file so it behaves the same whether it is run
--     by the script above or by `prisma db execute --file`.
--
-- There is ONE DROP, and it drops an index rather than data. An earlier
-- revision of this branch created `bulletins_publishedAt_idx`; review showed it
-- could not serve the query its comment named, because the admin list sorts by
-- `isPinned` first, so Postgres sorted anyway and the index cost a write on
-- every create, edit, pin and publish. The model no longer declares it.
--
-- Dropping it HERE rather than just deleting the CREATE is the point. Anyone who
-- already ran the previous revision — `npm run db:migrate:bulletins:local` landed
-- one commit before it changed — has the index in their database and not in the
-- schema. `scripts/check-drift.ts` classifies a stray index as destructive drift
-- and `npm run db:push` is `check-drift && prisma db push`, so push would be
-- blocked, with guidance blaming another worktree's branch. Re-running a
-- CREATE-only file never clears it.
--
-- No table or column is dropped. Before this change bulletins lived only in each
-- visitor's localStorage, so there is nothing in any database to reconcile or
-- lose.
--
-- To undo (there is no Prisma down path; this is the counterpart to run by hand):
--
--   BEGIN;
--   SELECT pg_advisory_xact_lock(4210771001);
--   DROP INDEX IF EXISTS "bulletins_publishedAt_idx";
--   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "bulletins";
--   DROP TYPE IF EXISTS "BulletinCategory";
--   DROP TYPE IF EXISTS "BulletinTargetPage";
--   DROP TYPE IF EXISTS "BulletinMediaType";
--   COMMIT;
--
-- That discards every staff-authored notice. It is the right move only while the
-- table still holds nothing but the seeded fixture.
