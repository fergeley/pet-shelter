-- The rest of the drift: the `shelter_settings` email and storage columns production lacks, and
-- the `notification_preferences.updatedAt` default master's schema does not declare.
--
-- Scope: this file, plus 20260922_pets_birth_date (expand) and 20260922_pets_birth_date_contract
-- (archive and drop) beside it, are together the whole of the drift
-- recorded in tasks/open/production-schema-has-drifted-ahead-of-master.md as of its 2026-09-18
-- re-measurement — one additive statement and two destructive ones, of which only the pet one
-- destroys anything. Applying both, plus that folder's cleanup.sql, takes
-- `npm run db:check-drift` to zero.
--
-- Nothing here is urgent in the way the pet conversion is. These columns are all nullable or
-- defaulted, so the deployed client reads them as NULL and carries on; no write is failing on
-- their account. They are here so the drift has one answer rather than a remainder.
--
-- Every `ADD COLUMN` is `IF NOT EXISTS` and every column is listed, not just the ones the
-- 2026-09-18 measurement happened to print before its 160-character truncation. That is
-- deliberate: the measurement's output is cut off mid-statement, so which of the seven are
-- actually missing is not known from it, and a list that is right either way beats a guess.
--
-- The `DROP DEFAULT` removes a column default, not rows. `updatedAt` stays NOT NULL, and Prisma
-- supplies it on every write because the model marks it `@updatedAt`. The only writer that would
-- notice is a hand-written INSERT omitting the column; there is none — the sole raw statement in
-- the codebase is a SELECT (`src/lib/server/faqRepository.ts:354`).
--
-- Safety: one transaction, same advisory lock key as the other manual migrations, every statement
-- idempotent and re-runnable, every table schema-qualified, 5-second lock timeout set inside the
-- block so it holds however an editor runs the file.
--
-- Apply: paste into the Neon SQL editor for the production branch. Verify with
--
--   SELECT column_name, data_type, column_default FROM information_schema.columns
--    WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'shelter_settings' ORDER BY column_name;
--   SELECT column_default FROM information_schema.columns
--    WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'notification_preferences'
--      AND column_name = 'updatedAt';                                      -- expect NULL
--
-- Undo: rollback.sql beside this file.
--
-- Rehearsed 2026-09-22 on PostgreSQL 17 (pglite) against a `shelter_settings` shaped like
-- production's (the seven columns absent) and a `notification_preferences` carrying the
-- CURRENT_TIMESTAMP default that 20260903_notification_preferences/migration.sql created: applied,
-- re-applied as a no-op, rolled back, and applied again.
