/**
 * Tier 3a — the guards `submitApplication` puts in front of a public adoption submission,
 * under `STRICT_PERSISTENCE=true`.
 *
 * The action used to resolve its target with `findServerPetById`, the synchronous mirror
 * reader, and then test `pet && pet.isArchived`. Three defects in those two lines, each fixed
 * here and each given a test below that goes red on its own revert:
 *
 *  1. the archive check read `src/data/pets.json` rather than the database;
 *  2. `pet && …` passed when nothing matched, so an unknown id was accepted;
 *  3. no status was checked at all, so an adopted animal accepted applications.
 *
 * Every rejection case is arranged under `pet-001` — a *real* row in `src/data/pets.json`,
 * Available and unarchived there. That is the point of this file. With an `itest-` id the
 * mirror returns null too, so the assertions would pass against the broken action for the
 * wrong reason: "not found" and "correctly refused" are the same `success: false`. See
 * `tasks/lessons/2026-09-10-ask-why-a-regression-test-passes-not-just-whether-it-fails.md`.
