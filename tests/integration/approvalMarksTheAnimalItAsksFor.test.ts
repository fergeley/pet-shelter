/**
 * Tier 3a — approving an adoption marks the animal the application names, and not whichever
 * animal happens to sit earlier in the in-memory mirror.
 *
 * `markCachedPetAdopted` used to take the first entry matching *either* identifier:
 *
 *     serverPets.find((p) => p.id === petId || p.name.toLowerCase() === petName.toLowerCase())
 *
 * `find` walks the array in order, so a **name** match on an earlier entry beat the exact **id**
 * match on a later one. Two shelter animals sharing a name is enough, and `pets.json` ships
 * common ones.
 *
 * What made that reachable rather than theoretical: the array's order is publicly influenceable.
 * `findServerPetByIdAsync` moves every animal it reads to the front of the mirror, and that read
 * sits behind an anonymous profile GET and — since the adoption submission guards landed — an
 * unauthenticated POST, before any check the submission would fail. So the caller chooses which
 * of two same-named animals is first, and `atomicUpdateApplicationStatus` then marks that one
 * Adopted on approval and writes *its* id into the `PET_STATUS_TRANSITION_ADOPTED` audit row.
 * The wrong animal is recorded as adopted, not merely cached as adopted.
 *
 * `tasks/open/a-public-post-can-reorder-the-pet-mirror.md` asks for exactly this test.
