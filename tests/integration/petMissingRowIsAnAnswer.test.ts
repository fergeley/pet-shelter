/**
 * Tier 3a — an animal the database does not hold is a missing animal, not a cue to
 * serve the bundled demo one.
 *
 * `findServerPetByIdAsync` used to fall through to the `src/data/pets.json` mirror on
 * *both* exits of its database branch: after a thrown query and after a query that
 * succeeded with no row. So an id present in the fixture but absent from a populated
 * database was served at its exact URL — `/pets` did not list it, because the catalogue
 * reader trusts whatever the database returns, so the animal was unreachable from the
 * grid and reachable by direct link. A hard-deleted row, or a fixture id production was
 * never seeded with, published a demo animal. The same read backs sponsorship checkout,
 * where it recorded a pledge against the fixture's name.
 *
 * The fix is the shape the two readers beside it already use: the fallback runs from the
 * `catch`, or when no database is configured, and never after a successful empty read.
 * `getServerPetsAsync` reaches it the same way (`softDeleteFiltering.test.ts`, "returns an
 * empty array without falling back to fixtures when the database is merely empty"), and so
 * does `getServerFaqsAsync` (`faqEmptyPublishSet.test.ts`).
 *
 * Every id below is `pet-001`, a real row in `src/data/pets.json` and unarchived there.
 * That is the whole point: an `itest-` id is absent from the mirror too, so the mirror
 * returns null for it and the assertion passes against the broken reader for the wrong
 * reason — the trap `softDeleteFiltering.test.ts` documents at its own null test.
 *
 * Both halves matter. Pinning only "a missing row returns null" would also pass against a
 * reader that had lost its fallback altogether, so the outage and no-database cases pin
 * that the fallback still exists and still runs.
