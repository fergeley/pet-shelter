/**
 * `.claude/hooks/agent-guard.mjs` is the only enforcement any sub-agent has,
 * and it enforces exactly two rules — both irreversible at the step:
 * `schema-auditor` "never connects to a database", `atomic-commit` "emits
 * commands, does not run them".
 *
 * There is deliberately no rule about an agent leaving product code modified.
 * That hazard exists only because two sessions share one working tree, and a
 * worktree per session dissolves it — measured free on this machine, since
 * `.claude/worktrees/` sits inside the repo and Node resolves `node_modules`
 * upward from there. See
 * tasks/decisions/2026-08-31-worktrees-are-free-and-the-guard-was-the-wrong-layer.md
 *
 * The guard is invoked by Claude Code, not by this repo, so nothing else here
 * exercises it. A regression in the git allowlist or the tool allowlist would
 * be invisible until an agent quietly did the thing it promised not to.
 *
 * **The shell-command fence is gone (2026-09-05), and with it 35 tests.** It
 * blocked `git reset --hard`, `rm -rf` and production database writes by parsing
 * command strings with regexes; three review rounds found 8, then 12, then 14
 * defects and the rate never fell. `permissions.deny` in `.claude/settings.json`
 * does that job now and the harness enforces it. What remains here is the two
 * agent rules, the drift log, and — in the wiring block — assertions about the
 * permission rules themselves plus a ledger of the twelve shapes prefix matching
 * cannot reach. See docs/tasks/TARGET_AGENT_GUARDRAILS.md.
 *
 * What this file does NOT establish: that Claude Code runs the hook. Frontmatter
 * hooks load from the definition as it stood at SESSION START, so a hook wired
 * mid-session never fires —
 * tasks/decisions/2026-08-31-agent-definitions-are-session-start-snapshots.md.
 * The liveness log is the only way to tell a working guard from a silent one.
 *
 * Background: tasks/decisions/2026-08-31-declared-tools-are-not-a-mechanism.md
