/**
 * Authorization reads the verified session, never the raw cookie.
 *
 * `getCurrentSession()` checks a cookie's signature and expiry and returns whatever role it
 * claims; `unsealSession()` does the same one level down. `getVerifiedSession()` (the DAL)
 * re-reads the member's status and role, which is the only thing that makes a suspension, a
 * deletion or a demotion take effect before the cookie's 24 hours are up. Every raw read outside
 * the security layer is a place where a suspended member can still act — the transparency and
 * FAQ actions were eleven such places until 2026-09-18.
 *
 * `tests/unit/serverActionAuth.test.ts` cannot see this: it checks that an action calls an
 * authorization helper, not where that helper's session came from.
