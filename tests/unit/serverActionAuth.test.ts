/**
 * Every exported function in a `"use server"` module is an HTTP POST endpoint
 * whose action id ships in the client bundle. Anyone can call it.
 *
 * This is not theoretical here: `loadShelterSettings` and `getShelterSettings`
 * were both added as innocuous "read helpers" and both returned the entire
 * shelter settings object — `resendApiKey` included — to any caller. The
 * authorization reflex fires on mutations, so a read slipped past it twice.
 *
 * This guard makes that a deliberate choice rather than an oversight: a new
 * action either performs an authorization check or is listed below with a
 * reason. It cannot be silently neither.
