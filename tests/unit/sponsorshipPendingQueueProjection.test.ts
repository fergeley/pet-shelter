/**
 * What `listPendingSponsorships` hands back, in both of its branches: never the
 * supporter's tax identifier.
 *
 * `tests/integration/db/sponsorshipLedger.postgres.test.ts` runs the Prisma branch
 * against a real server, but only where one exists — CI's Postgres job, or
 * `embedded-postgres` locally. This file is the signal `npm test` gives without one.
 * For the Prisma branch, `DATABASE_URL` is stubbed to an unreachable dummy so
 * `isLedgerPersistent()` takes it, and `@/lib/server/prisma` is doubled so nothing
 * dials it. **Never the real `.env.local` value**: that is the production branch
 * (`.claude/templates/triage-rules.md` §1).
 *
 * The double honours `select` the way Prisma does — the selected columns, or every
 * column when there is no `select`. A double that returned a fixed row whatever it was
 * asked would make the tax-identifier assertion pass for any query, an experiment whose
 * input equals its control.
 *
 * Its own file because `vi.mock` is file-scoped: a double that knows only
 * `petSponsorship` breaks any neighbouring test that reaches another model. It did
 * exactly that when first added to a reconciliation suite, where `recordAuditLog`
 * calls `prisma.auditLog.create` unconditionally.
