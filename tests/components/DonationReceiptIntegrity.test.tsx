/**
 * A receipt number is allocated by `issueDonationReceipt` inside the same
 * transaction that writes the `Donation` row — that is what makes the series
 * gapless and what lets the LHDN export reconcile against the ledger.
 *
 * The widget used to answer a failed submission by minting its own
 * `HFS-DON-<month>-<random 4 digits>` in the browser and rendering it on the
 * printable receipt. The donor would then hold a tax document for a gift the
 * shelter has no record of, carrying a number that may already belong to a real
 * receipt. These tests exist so that fallback cannot come back.
 *
 * Since 2026-09-22 the guard is stronger still: this screen has no receipt on it
 * at all. Submitting the form records a pending pledge, and the Section 44(6)
 * receipt is issued from the coordinator's queue once the transfer is matched. So
 * `RECEIPT_NUMBER` must not appear here on *any* path, success included.
