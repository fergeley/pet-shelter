/**
 * Tier 4: that `Hero` mounts no dialog it cannot open.
 *
 * `Hero` held `isQuizOpen`/`isSponsorshipOpen` and mounted `PetMatchQuiz` and
 * `SponsorshipModal` with them, passing the setters only to the dialogs' own
 * `onOpenChange` — which can close a dialog but never open one. The buttons
 * that drove them were removed by `68b1981` and `112c78e`; neither removed the
 * mounts. Visitors lost nothing when they went: `Navbar` mounts both on every
 * page and `PetGallery`'s header buttons render on `/` outside its `showFilters`
 * block, so `/` still offers both.
 *
 * Asserting on the DOM cannot prove this. A dialog with `open={false}` renders
 * no nodes, so the tree looks identical whether or not it is mounted. Nor can a
 * `localStorage` spy: the dialogs' stores are module-level, so they read their
 * keys when the module is first imported, before any `beforeEach` can install a
 * spy — a spy-based version of this test passed against the unfixed component.
 *
 * What does discriminate is whether the component functions are invoked at all,
 * which is what these module mocks record. They are registered here rather than
 * in `home.test.tsx` so that the substitution cannot affect any other suite.
