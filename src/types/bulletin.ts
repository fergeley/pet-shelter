/**
 * One bulletin as the public feed renders it.
 *
 * This is the *resolved* projection: the repository substitutes the English
 * copy for any missing Malay field before handing it out, so every reader gets
 * a plain `string` and no page can render a blank Malay title. It mirrors
 * `FaqItem` against `FaqRecord` next door.
 *
 * `publishedAt` is an ISO date string (`YYYY-MM-DD`) rather than a `Date`,
 * because it is a notice date that a card prints verbatim — not an instant. It
 * crosses a server/client boundary as a prop, and a `Date` would be serialised
 * and revived into whatever the viewer's timezone made of it, which is how a
 * clinic "this Saturday" becomes Friday for anyone west of the shelter.
