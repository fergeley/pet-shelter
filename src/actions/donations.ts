 * Server Action: records a general gift a supporter says they have sent.
 *
 * ## What changed on 2026-09-22, and why
 *
 * This action used to issue an official LHDN Section 44(6) receipt here, from the
 * form submission alone. Nothing had observed a bank statement at that point — the
 * donor was shown a DuitNow QR and told us they paid — so a public form minted
 * statutory tax documents for money the shelter had not received. Anyone could
 * produce one. `tasks/decisions/2026-09-22-general-gifts-become-pending-until-
 * reconciled.md` records the fix; the fix is that this function no longer touches
 * the receipt series at all.
 *
 * What it writes is a `PENDING_PAYMENT` row and an `HFS-GFT` reference for the
 * donor to quote on their transfer. `reconcileDonationPledgeAction` is the only
 * path to a receipt, and it runs when a coordinator has matched the money.
 *
 * ## Ordering is still load-bearing
 *
 *   1. validate → 2. rate-limit → 3. persist the pledge → 4. audit → 5. email
 *
 * If step 3 does not return a confirmed outcome, steps 4 and 5 never start. A lost
 * commit acknowledgement cannot prove rollback, so the donor is told the outcome is
 * unconfirmed and to check with the shelter before retrying, rather than being
 * invited to submit the same gift twice. Pledges never fall back to memory when
 * Postgres is configured.

 * The LHDN receipts export, served from the donation ledger.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The export used to be assembled in the browser from `fetchAuditLogsAction(250)` —
 * the 250 most recent audit rows *of any kind*. Pet edits, logins and application
 * approvals consume that budget, so on a shelter with ordinary admin traffic older
 * receipts fell off the annual return while the UI reported success. The export
 * engine predates the ledger: it landed 2026-08-16, `donationLedger.ts` on
 * 2026-08-27, the `Donation` model on 2026-08-29. It read the audit trail because
 * that was the only source of donation data at the time.
 *
 * ## Unreconciled gifts cannot appear here, structurally
 *
 * This reads `donations`, which holds issued receipts and nothing else. A gift
 * awaiting a coordinator lives in `donation_pledges` and has no receipt number at
 * all, so it cannot reach an annual return however this query is later changed.
 * That is deliberately a property of where the rows live rather than of a `where`
 * clause somebody has to remember — before 2026-09-22 the whole defect was that
 * unverified money looked exactly like verified money once it was in this table.
 *
 * ## An outage must not read as "no donations"
 *
 * The read goes through `listDonationsOrThrow`, not `listDonations`. The latter
 * returns `[]` on any read failure, so a Neon outage would arrive here as a
 * successful, empty statutory return — indistinguishable from a shelter that took
 * no donations, and wrong in a way nobody downstream can detect.
 *
 * ## Truncation is observed, not inferred
 *
 * We ask the ledger for one row more than we will return. `records.length > bounded`
 * is then a fact about the data rather than a guess from `length === limit`, which
 * cannot tell a full page from an exact fit. The caller is expected to surface
 * `truncated` — a receipt missing from a tax filing is the defect this replaces,
 * and moving the cap without reporting it would only change the number at which
 * the same silence begins.
 *
 * Returns `DonationReceiptDTO`, mapped by the same `toReceiptDTO` the receipt email
 * uses, so the two cannot disagree about what a receipt says. The exact integer sen
 * becomes ringgit at that one boundary.
