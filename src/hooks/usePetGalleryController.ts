 * tab and offered a Reset that reset nothing; `?status=Rehabilitation` filtered correctly while

 *
 * So every value is resolved once, here, and everything downstream — matching, option lists,
 * the highlighted control, `hasActiveFilters` — reads the same resolved value:
 *
 * - an unrecognised value means "not filtering", never "match nothing", so a bad link widens the
 *   grid instead of emptying it behind a control that cannot explain why;
 * - a recognised status is reported in its canonical spelling, so the legacy alias selects the
 *   option that actually exists.
 *
 * Accepted values come from `petFilterSchema` and `PET_TRACK_SEQUENCE` rather than a list here,
