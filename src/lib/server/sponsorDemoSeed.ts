/**
 * Demo commitments for the three seeded supporter accounts, offline only.
 *
 * Recorded through `recordSponsorshipPledge` and moved to `ACTIVE` through
 * `reconcileSponsorship`, rather than fabricated as rows. That matters: it means the
 * offline demo exercises the same pledge-reference allocation, the same sen arithmetic
 * and the same `PENDING_PAYMENT → ACTIVE` transition as production. A hand-built fixture
 * would let all three drift without a single test noticing.
 *
 * Each account is positioned to land on a different standing purely through `deriveTier`,
 * and Bronze carries one commitment aged out of the recognition window — which is what
 * demonstrates that standings decay rather than accumulate for life.
