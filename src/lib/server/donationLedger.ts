/**
 * Persistence for issued LHDN tax receipts.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a dual-layer repository
 *
 * `src/lib/server/` wraps every Prisma call in try/catch and falls back to the JSON
 * fixtures in `src/data/`. That is the right design for **reference data** — pets,
 * FAQs, rehab needs — because such data has an authoritative committed fixture, so
 * serving it from memory is degraded but truthful.
 *
 * A donation is not reference data. It is a record that an external event occurred:
 * money moved. There cannot be a fixture for an event that has not happened yet, so
 * "fall back to the fixture" has no meaning here, and swallowing a failed write
 * would hand a donor an official, tax-deductible receipt number for a record that
 * exists nowhere durable. That is the failure this module refuses to have.
 *
 * The fallback is therefore replaced by an explicitly **declared mode**, chosen by
 * configuration rather than by whether an error happened to be thrown:
 *
 * - `DATABASE_URL` set — Postgres is authoritative. A failed write propagates, the
 *   Server Action reports failure, and no receipt is issued. Losing a donation
 *   record silently is strictly worse than telling the donor to retry.
 * - `DATABASE_URL` unset — the in-memory ledger is authoritative. This is the
 *   documented offline mode the whole project runs and tests in, and it stays fully
 *   functional: numbering is still gapless, just per-process.
 *
 * The distinction matters because those two situations are not the same event. A
 * missing `DATABASE_URL` is a deliberate configuration. A configured database that
 * rejects a write is a fault, and faults on statutory records must be loud.
 *
 * ## Append-only
 *
 * There is no update or delete export, by design. See the `Donation` model comment
 * in `prisma/schema.prisma`; corrections are issued as new offsetting records.
