/**
 * Repository for general gifts awaiting reconciliation.
 *
 * ## What this table is for
 *
 * A supporter fills in the public donation form, is shown a DuitNow QR or the
 * shelter's bank details, and tells us they paid. That is all the application
 * knows. Until 2026-09-22 `submitDonationPledgeAction` treated it as proof and
 * allocated an official `HFS-DON-*` Section 44(6) receipt on the spot, so a public
 * form minted tax documents for money nobody had counted. This module holds the
 * gift in `PENDING_PAYMENT` until a coordinator matches the transfer, and the
 * receipt is drawn at that boundary and nowhere else.
 *
 * ## Why the gift is not a pending `Donation`
 *
 * `Donation` is an issued receipt: append-only, and production enforces that below
 * the ORM with `donations_no_mutation` (`prisma/sql/donation_append_only.sql`,
 * applied 2026-09-21). A pending row written there could never be updated to carry
 * its receipt number — the trigger refuses every UPDATE — so the design would fail
 * in production and pass everywhere else. `PetSponsorship` made the same call for
 * the same reason, and this module is deliberately its twin.
 *
 * The happy consequence: the statutory export reads `donations`, so an
 * unreconciled gift is invisible to an LHDN return by construction. No reader has
 * a filter to forget.
 *
 * ## Two declared modes, not a try/catch fallback
 *
 * The contract `donationLedger.ts` documents, with `isLedgerPersistent()` imported
 * from it rather than re-derived so the three ledgers cannot disagree about which
 * mode the process is in. `DATABASE_URL` set means Postgres is authoritative and an
 * unconfirmed write propagates; unset means the in-memory ledger is, which is the
 * documented offline mode the project tests in.
