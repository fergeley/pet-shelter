 * imported from it rather than re-derived so the two can never disagree about
 * which mode the process is in:
 *
 * - `DATABASE_URL` set — Postgres is authoritative and an unconfirmed write
 *   propagates. No in-memory fallback can pretend it succeeded.
 * - `DATABASE_URL` unset — the in-memory ledger is authoritative. This is a
 *   deliberate configuration (local dev, unit tests), not a degraded database.
 *
 * The distinction matters here more than usual: reconciliation issues a receipt.
 * If a commit acknowledgement is lost, the caller must surface that uncertainty
 * and read back before retrying; silently switching stores is never an answer.
