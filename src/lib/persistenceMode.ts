/**
 * Strict-persistence switch for the repository layer.
 *
 * The dual-layer store (docs/architecture/LAYERS.md, L-B2) deliberately swallows
 * Prisma errors and falls back to the in-memory JSON fixtures, so the app runs
 * with no database at all. That same forgiveness makes it impossible for an
 * integration test to tell a working query from a broken one: a schema drift, a
 * renamed column, or a malformed `where` clause all "pass" by silently serving
 * fixture data.
 *
 * Setting `STRICT_PERSISTENCE=true` disables the fallback and rethrows, so the
 * Tier-3 suite fails loudly on the real defect instead of green-lighting it.
 *
 * The flag is read on every call rather than captured at module load, so
 * `vi.stubEnv("STRICT_PERSISTENCE", ...)` works inside an already-imported module.
