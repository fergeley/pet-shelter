/**
 * The hex mirror of the light-theme design tokens, for HTML email.
 *
 * ## Why a mirror exists at all
 *
 * `src/app/globals.css` is the single source of truth for colour, and every surface in
 * `src/` reads it through a generated Tailwind utility that resolves to `var(--token)`.
 * Mail clients support neither custom properties nor `oklch()`, so an email that referenced
 * a token would arrive at the donor's inbox as colourless markup. This module is the one
 * place allowed to restate those values as literal hex — and
 * `tests/unit/designSystemGuards.test.ts` proves every entry below still equals the computed
 * value of the token it names. A drifted value fails the build; it does not quietly ship a
 * shelter-branded app with slate-and-sky email, which is the state this replaced.
 *
 * ## The naming rule is the mapping
 *
 * There is deliberately no `{ constant → token }` lookup table anywhere, here or in the
 * guard. A table would be the palette written a third time, and this repo's recurring defect
 * is exactly that: one value maintained in two places by hand until it isn't. Instead the
 * key *is* the token name, by a rule the guard recomputes:
 *
 * - `EMAIL_BRAND.mutedForeground` mirrors `--muted-foreground`
 * - `EMAIL_TONE.care.surface`     mirrors `--tone-care-surface`
 * - `EMAIL_RECEIPT.inkAccent`     mirrors `--receipt-ink-accent`
 *
 * camelCase → kebab-case, and nothing else. Adding an entry therefore adds its own parity
 * assertion; misspelling one fails loudly, because the guard treats a token it cannot find
 * as an error rather than skipping it.
 *
 * ## Light theme only, on purpose
 *
 * `.dark` is not mirrored and its absence is not an oversight. A mail client does not carry
 * the app's `.dark` class, and `prefers-color-scheme` support across clients is inconsistent
 * enough that a dark email palette is its own piece of work. Email renders the `:root`
 * values.
 *
 * Background: `docs/tasks/TARGET_EMAIL_COLOUR_PARITY.md`.
