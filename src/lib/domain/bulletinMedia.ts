/**
 * Host allow-lists for bulletin media.
 *
 * A bulletin carries two caller-supplied URLs, and before this module neither
 * was checked. `videoEmbedUrl` is interpolated straight into an `<iframe src>`
 * on `/`, `/pets` and `/bulletins`, so an arbitrary value there is an arbitrary
 * third-party frame on every public page — running its own script, in the
 * shelter's frame, under the shelter's name. `mediaUrl` goes to `next/image`,
 * which refuses any host missing from `next.config.ts` `images.remotePatterns`
 * and answers 400, so an unchecked value is a broken card rather than a hazard.
 *
 * Both are validated on the way in (`bulletinFormSchema`) and again on the way
 * out (`toPublicMediaUrl` / `toPublicEmbedUrl`). The second check is the
 * enforcing one, and it is not redundant: rows reach this table without passing
 * the action. `prisma/seed.ts` inserts fixtures, and
 * `prisma/migrations/manual/20260922_community_bulletins` is applied by hand
 * against a branch this code never sees. A write-time check alone would be a
 * guard on the one path that is already trusted.
 */

/**
 * Hosts `next/image` will load, held in step with the `images.remotePatterns`
 * list in `next.config.ts` by `tests/unit/bulletins.test.ts`. The patterns are
 * written exactly as Next writes them, `**.` included, because the two lists
 * have to mean the same thing and the cheapest way to guarantee that is to
 * spell them the same.
 *
 * `**.` matches one or more leading labels, which is Next's reading. An earlier
 * revision used `*.` and matched exactly one, which was stricter than the
 * config: `abc.storage.supabase.co` was refused by the form while `next/image`
 * would have served it, and the refusal pointed the editor at a config file
 * that did allow it.
 *
 * Deliberately a copy rather than an import: `next.config.ts` is loaded by the
 * Next build, not by application code, and importing it into `src/` would pull
 * build configuration into the runtime bundle. The test is what keeps the two
 * honest — see "Boundaries and duplication" in AGENTS.md, which asks for a
 * guard when two copies must agree.
