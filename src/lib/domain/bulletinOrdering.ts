/**
 * The bulletin feed's ordering, as pure logic.
 *
 * It lives in the domain layer rather than inside the repository for the reason
 * `planFaqRenumber` does: the repository's database path delegates ordering to
 * Postgres, so the only way to exercise this rule directly is to have it
 * somewhere a test can call with rows of its own choosing. Ties are the case
 * that matters, and the committed fixture has no two notices on one day.
 *
 * It must stay in step with the `orderBy` in `getPublicBulletins` and
 * `listBulletinRecords`. Where they disagree, an outage silently reorders the
 * feed — which is a worse failure than an outage, because nothing reports it.
 * `BULLETIN_FEED_ORDER_BY` below is the shared declaration; the repository
 * spreads it rather than writing its own literal.
 *
 * `createdAt` is compared as a full ISO instant, which is what
 * `BulletinRecord` carries. An earlier revision truncated it to `YYYY-MM-DD`
 * for "consistency" with `publishedAt` and thereby made this tiebreaker dead:
 * every row compared equal here while Postgres ordered on `TIMESTAMP(3)`.

 *
 * Plain `>` compares UTF-16 code units. Be honest about what that buys: it
 * matches Postgres exactly only under `C` collation, and under the usual
 * `en_US.UTF-8` an `ORDER BY id DESC` applies ICU rules that weaken case and
 * punctuation. For the lowercase-alphanumeric cuids this table actually holds,
 * code-unit order and ICU order agree, so the two paths agree in practice.
 *
 * It is still preferred over `localeCompare`, which is locale-sensitive at
 * runtime and so could differ between two machines running this same code. The
 * residual gap is ids outside that character set, which nothing produces today;
 * if one ever does, the tiebreaker should move to a column whose ordering is
 * collation-independent rather than this comment growing another paragraph.

 * to the OLDEST notice, so a feed limited to two items would deterministically
 * drop the one written most recently that day — the exact failure a tiebreaker
