/**
 * Exact monetary arithmetic for MYR amounts.
 *
 * ## Why sen, and not `Float` or Prisma `Decimal`
 *
 * Donation amounts back **LHDN Section 44(6) tax-deductible receipts**, so an
 * amount that is off by a hundredth of a cent is a defective statutory document,
 * not a rounding curiosity. Three candidate representations were considered:
 *
 * - `Float` / JS `number` in ringgit — rejected. `0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3`, and summing
 *   a year of donations for an ROS annual return accumulates the error.
 * - Prisma `Decimal` (`@db.Decimal(10,2)`) — exact in the database, but crosses
 *   the `"use server"` boundary as a class instance. Next.js serializes Server
 *   Action results structurally, so a `Decimal` arrives at the client as a plain
 *   object (or throws), and every consumer needs to remember to rehydrate it.
 *   Exactness that depends on every call site remembering something is brittle.
 * - **Integer sen** — chosen. 1 ringgit = 100 sen, stored as an `Int`. Exact
 *   under addition and comparison, serializes as a number across every boundary,
 *   and has no library or driver dependency. This is the representation Stripe
 *   and most payment processors use, for the same reasons.
 *
 * `Int` tops out at 2,147,483,647 sen ≈ RM 21.4 million, comfortably above the
 * RM 100,000 per-donation ceiling in `donationPledgeSchema`. Postgres promotes
 * `sum(int)` to `bigint`, so aggregate reporting does not overflow either.
 *
 * ## The brand
 *
 * `Sen` is a branded number: a plain integer at runtime, but not assignable from
 * an unbranded `number`. That makes the one genuinely dangerous mistake in money
 * code — passing ringgit where sen is expected, silently under-charging by 100x —
 * a compile error instead of a defect discovered during an audit.
