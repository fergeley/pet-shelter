 * Next.js calls `register` once per server instance, and it must complete before
 * the server accepts requests — which makes it the correct place to fail a
 * production boot carrying unsafe authentication secrets.
 *
 * Deliberately not guarded on `NEXT_RUNTIME`: `secrets.ts` imports nothing and
 * only reads `process.env`, so it is safe on both the Node.js and Edge runtimes,
 * and a misconfigured deploy should fail on either.
 *
 * In development and test this throws nothing; it surfaces the one-time warning
 * for each weak secret at startup instead of on the first request that needs one.
