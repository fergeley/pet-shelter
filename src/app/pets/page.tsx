/**
 * Kept dynamic explicitly.
 *
 * This page was dynamic by accident of reading `searchParams`, and dropping that prop below
 * would otherwise have made it statically prerendered — a silent rendering-mode change, made in
 * a worktree where `next build` cannot run to observe it. Two things make that worth pinning
 * rather than discovering later: a build that cannot reach the database bakes the `pets.json`
 * fixtures into the page until the next revalidation
 * (`tasks/open/pets-json-fallback-empty-means-outage.md`), and the catalogue is the surface
 * where a stale animal is most visible. `/faq`, `/get-involved` and `/sponsors` already say this
 * the same way.

  // population the gallery receives, so pre-narrowing to `?status=Pending` would report every
  // other track as empty and hide the tabs that lead out of it.

  // hundreds); page it, or move faceting to the server, if the catalogue outgrows ~500.
