/**
 * Mirror `tasks/open/` into GitHub issues, one issue per entry.
 *
 * One-way. The file is the source of truth and the issue is a rendered copy: an issue edited on
 * GitHub is overwritten on the next run, an issue whose entry left `tasks/open/` is closed, and a
 * closed issue whose entry is still open is reopened. Comments are never touched, so discussion
 * belongs there — and a conclusion reached in a comment settles nothing until it reaches the file.
 * Rationale: `tasks/decisions/2026-09-18-ledger-issues-are-a-one-way-mirror.md`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/ledger-issues.mjs                    # dry run: print the plan, publish nothing
 *   node scripts/ledger-issues.mjs --apply            # publish the plan
 *   node scripts/ledger-issues.mjs --branch <name>    # mirror a branch other than the default
 *
 * Entries are read from `origin/<branch>` after a fetch, never from the working tree. Run from a
 * feature branch, a working-tree read would publish unmerged entries and close the issues of
 * entries that branch has not merged yet.
 *
 * Dependency-free on purpose, like `commit-msg.mjs`: it needs `git` and an authenticated `gh`,
 * nothing from `node_modules`.
