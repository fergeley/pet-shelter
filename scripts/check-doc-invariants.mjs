/**
 * Cross-reference guard for the numbered invariants.
 *
 * Nine invariants used to live under `## Invariants` in CLAUDE.md and are cited by number
 * across the agents, skills, templates and the hook. Numbered cross-references are the most
 * fragile shape a duplicated rule can take: the citation site and the definition site are
 * different files, so a rewrite of the definition file leaves every citation pointing at
 * nothing, and nothing errors. That is exactly what happened on 2026-09-05 — a CLAUDE.md
 * rewrite deleted all nine while the replacement text itself still cited two of them.
 *
 * Adapted from the idea in Ponytail's `scripts/check-rule-copies.js`
 * (github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail, MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 DietrichGebert), which pins
 * invariant substrings across the eight copies of its ruleset. Theirs asserts presence of a
 * phrase; this asserts that a citation resolves, which is the shape this repo actually uses.
 *
 * Two rules make this a guard rather than furniture:
 *
 *   1. It DISCOVERS its inputs (`git ls-files`) instead of being handed a list. A guard given
 *      a hardcoded file list cannot see the copy that was added after it was written — which
 *      is the duplication it exists to catch. See tasks/decisions/ and the auto-memory note
 *      `guard-must-read-every-copy`.
 *   2. It asserts a FLOOR. If the corpus or the reference regex breaks, the natural failure
 *      mode is "found nothing, therefore nothing is wrong" — a green guard that checks air.
 *      Below the floor it fails loudly instead.
 *
 * LIVE vs ARCHIVE: `tasks/decisions/` and `docs/tasks/` record what was true when written and
 * are expected to cite invariants that later changed. They are reported, never fatal. Files
 * that steer current behaviour are fatal.
 *
