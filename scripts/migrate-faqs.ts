/**
 * Applies the FAQ migration and seeds `src/data/faqs.json` into it.
 *
 * Separate from `prisma/seed.ts` for two reasons. That script is refused
 * against anything but a local database (`assertSeedTargetIsLocal`), because it
 * is not additive — it deletes and rewrites pets, applications and staff users
 * from fixtures. This one only ever touches the `faqs` table, so it is safe to
 * point at a hosted branch, which is what makes the FAQ page's content
 * deployable without a full reseed.
 *
 * `DATABASE_URL` is resolved through `prisma/env.ts`, the single resolver every
 * database-touching script shares, so this cannot end up talking to a different
 * database than `db:push` or `db:check-drift`.
 *
 * Prints the table list before and after so the blast radius is visible.
