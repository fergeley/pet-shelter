/**
 * Applies the community bulletin migration and seeds `src/data/bulletins.json` into it.
 *
 * **Re-running it never overwrites an existing notice.** Rows are inserted with
 * `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, so staff edits made through /admin/bulletins survive
 * a second run. See the comment on the INSERT for why that matters more here
 * than in the seed.
 *
 * Separate from `prisma/seed.ts` for the reason `migrate-faqs.ts` gives: that
 * script is refused against anything but a local database
 * (`assertSeedTargetIsLocal`), because it is not additive — it deletes and
 * rewrites pets, applications and staff users from fixtures. This one only ever
 * touches the `bulletins` table, so it is safe to point at a hosted branch,
 * which is what makes the launch notices deployable without a full reseed.
 *
 * It is ALSO the only safe way to put this table on the production branch.
 * `npm run db:push` reconciles the whole schema, and
 * `tasks/open/production-schema-has-drifted-ahead-of-master.md` records three
 * destructive statements currently standing between master's schema and that
 * database — two of which lose data and have nothing to do with bulletins.
 *
 * `DATABASE_URL` is resolved through `prisma/env.ts`, the single resolver every
 * database-touching script shares, so this cannot end up talking to a different
 * database than `db:push` or `db:check-drift`.
 *
 * Prints the table list before and after so the blast radius is visible.
