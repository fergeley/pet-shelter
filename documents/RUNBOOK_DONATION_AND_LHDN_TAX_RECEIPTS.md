## 3. E-Receipt Issuance & Verification Flow

### Standard Automated Lifecycle
```
1. Donor selects package (or custom RM) on /donate or pet profile modal
2. Donor completes DuitNow transfer / Maybank payment
3. Donor enters Name, Email, Phone, and optional IC/SSM
4. System executes Server Action (submitDonationPledgeAction):
   ├── Validates inputs via Zod
   ├── Assigns unique receipt number: HFS-DON-YYYYMM-XXXX
   ├── Records immutable entry in audit log (DONATION_RECEIVED)
   └── Dispatches HTML/Plain text receipt via Resend
5. On-screen printable receipt is immediately displayed to donor
```

### Manual Audit Log Inspection
Shelter coordinators can review recorded donations in the admin panel:
1. Navigate to `/admin/audit`.
2. Filter or search by `Action: DONATION_RECEIVED` or `Entity: DonationReceipt`.
3. View donor name, email, amount (RM), dedication animal, and receipt number.

---

## 4. Printing & PDF Export Guide

Both the modal and dedicated `/donate` page feature an optimized **Print / Save Receipt** button.

### How to Save as Clean PDF:
1. Click **Print / Save Receipt** on the completed receipt screen.
2. In the browser print dialog:
   - **Destination**: Select *Save as PDF* (or select physical printer).
   - **Paper Size**: A4 or Letter.
   - **Headers & Footers**: Uncheck (the receipt already includes full official headers).
   - **Background Graphics**: Checked.
3. Click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> The custom `@media print` stylesheet automatically isolates the official tax voucher `#donation-receipt-print`. Web navigation bars, close buttons, and backdrop shadows are automatically excluded from the final output.

## 5. In-Kind Wishlist & Physical Drop-off Procedures

For donors visiting the shelter in person with physical goods:

### Receiving Checklist:
1. **Food Items**: Ensure dog/cat kibble bags and puppy milk formulas (KMR/Esbilac) are **unopened and within expiration date**.
2. **Medical Supplies**: Accept unopened hospital-grade disinfectants (Clorox, F10), disposable pee pads, sterile gloves, and flea/tick preventatives (Frontline/Bravecto).
3. **Bedding & Towels**: Clean bath towels and fleece blankets are accepted. Damaged items with loose nylon strings should be recycled safely.
4. **Recording**: Record in-kind donations in the physical sanctuary intake logbook at the front reception.

## 6. Corporate Donations & SSM Tax Exemption

Malaysian companies wishing to claim tax deductions on donations:

1. **Information Required**:
   - Registered Corporate Entity Name (e.g. *Apex Technologies Sdn Bhd*).
   - SSM Registration Number (e.g. *202101023456 (1423756-X)*).
   - Official Finance / Accounts Email.
2. **Procedure**:
   - The corporate donor enters their SSM number in the `NRIC / Passport / SSM No.` field.
   - The receipt will explicitly display the company name and SSM number under the *Issued To* section.
   - For wire transfers exceeding RM 5,000, finance staff can issue an official signed certificate upon request by emailing `donations@hopeforstrays.org`.

## 7. Troubleshooting & Incident Scenarios

### Scenario A: Donor Did Not Receive Receipt Email
1. **Check Spam / Junk Folder**: Transactional emails are sent from `onboarding@resend.dev` (or custom verified domain).
2. **Verify in Audit Log**:
   - Open `/admin/audit`.
   - Search for the donor's email address.
   - Check if `EMAIL_SENT` or `EMAIL_FAILED` is logged.
3. **Resending / Re-printing**:
   - If the donor is on the phone or in person, look up the receipt number in `/admin/audit` and provide the PDF or print a replacement voucher.

### Scenario B: "Too many submissions" Rate Limit Error
- **Root Cause**: The donor submitted more than 20 times within 5 minutes (`checkRateLimit`).
- **Resolution**: Advise the donor to wait 5 minutes before submitting again, or complete their direct transfer using the Maybank account number shown on-screen.

### Scenario C: Custom Amount Validation Error
- **Root Cause**: The donor entered an amount below RM 5.00 or an invalid character.
- **Resolution**: Remind the donor that the minimum transaction threshold is RM 5.00 to offset banking rail overheads.
