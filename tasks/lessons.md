## 2026-08-30 — Report length is priced to the decision, exactly like ceremony

Building the Midwife agent, the same correction landed twice: "i dont understand, explain it
simply", then "why is it so long. just tell me if the midwife works or not". Both times the work
was sound and the report was the defect. Four litmus tests had run; the answer the human needed
was one word and one open decision, and it was buried under a results table, a verification
excerpt and three sub-findings.

This is the spec's own rule applied to its own output. `midwife.md` §2 says ceremony is priced to
the decision and that GRAVE ceremony on a FAST task "teaches the human to route around you." A
GRAVE-sized *report* on a question with a yes/no answer does the identical damage, and the spec's
report format (Open → Settled → Shipped) actively invites it, because Open-first reads as
permission to enumerate.

**Rule:** lead with the verdict in one line, then the decision the human actually has to make.
Everything else is available on request and belongs in the ledger, which is where a reader who
wants it will look. The report is not the work; a long report about verified work is an unpriced
tax on the person who asked. When the question was "does it work", "yes" is the whole first line.

## 2026-08-30 — Sandbox any agent test whose lane can reach a build

Litmus-testing the Midwife spec, four tests were dispatched. Three ran in throwaway directories.
The fourth — a deliberately fuzzy ticket — was classified "read-mostly" and pointed at the live
repo, on the reasoning that investigating a vague complaint is exploration.

It triaged GRAVE, ran the full lane, and Phase 4 *is a build*. It made two real commits to a
shared branch. The work was good and was kept, but nobody had asked for it.

**Rule:** the blast radius of an agent test is the blast radius of the widest lane its prompt can
trigger, not the narrowest. A prompt that can be triaged GRAVE ends in a commit by design. Copy
the agent config into a scratch directory and point the run there, or accept that the test is a
change to the repository.

## 2026-08-28 — ISO date-only parsing in JavaScript requires timezone-invariant extraction

`new Date("YYYY-MM-DD")` is parsed by ECMAScript engines as UTC midnight (`00:00:00Z`). In timezones located west of UTC (negative offsets like UTC-1 to UTC-12), calling `.getDate()` or `.getMonth()` rolls the date backward by 1 day to the previous evening, causing silent 1-month or 1-day threshold calculation bugs on exact boundaries.

**Rule:** never pass date-only strings (`YYYY-MM-DD`) directly to `new Date()` for calendar math. Extract the year, month, and day integers directly from string parts (`parseDateParts`) before doing month/year difference math to ensure 100% deterministic results across all server and client locales.

## 2026-08-28 — Dual-layer persistence requires Chesterton's Fence analysis before refactoring fallbacks

Dual-layer stores (`Prisma` with in-memory JSON fallback) seem like redundant code duplication and maintenance burden at first glance. However, ripping them out completely would either break sub-second, zero-dependency unit tests or silently break test doubles (`prismaDouble.ts`) that rely on query fallback behaviors.

**Rule:** before simplifying fallback stores, discover their load-bearing invariants through test runs. Ensure that:
1. Pure unit tests run without local DB timeouts via clean in-memory state.
2. Tier 3 strict persistence integration tests (`STRICT_PERSISTENCE=true`) rethrow real database failures rather than masking them.
3. Repositories maintain single-source-of-truth invariants without creating race conditions or phantom data resurrection.

## 2026-08-28 — Domain lifecycle derivation beats static prose storage for temporal entities

Rescues rarely have birth certificates; intake forms routinely capture estimates like `"2 years"` or `"4 months"`. Storing that prose string directly in database columns (`Pet.age`, `Pet.ageCategory`) creates silent data rot: an animal admitted as `"young"` at `"2 years"` remains frozen in time years later, compromising adoption matching engines, medical alerts, and gallery filters.

**Rule:** decouple intake approximation from storage. Store canonical temporal anchors (`birthDate: String` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and `birthDateIsEstimate: Boolean`) at the persistence boundary. Derive human-readable strings (`"2 years"`, `"4 bulan"`) and lifecycle stages (`"puppy_kitten"`, `"young"`, `"adult"`, `"senior"`) dynamically in a pure domain calculation module (`src/lib/domain/petAge.ts`) at read time. Projection layers (`petMappers.ts`) can supply computed properties seamlessly without breaking client components.


## 2026-08-28 — Never break the shared tree on purpose; the other session repairs it into history

This repo's own rule is to break a guard once and watch it fail — a guard never seen red is not
known to work. Applied to the newly union-keyed `FAQ_CATEGORY_LABELS`, that meant adding an eighth
member to `FaqCategory` to prove an unlisted category becomes a compile error. It does: TS2741, at
the single declaration. The property was real and the check was worth making.

But the injection lived in the working tree for about two minutes, and the parallel session read
the error as a genuine missing case. It added the label entry *and* an `adoption_events` member to
`FAQ_CATEGORIES` in the Zod validator, then committed both. Reverting the union afterwards did not
restore the status quo — it inverted the error (TS2353) and left a category nobody asked for in
history, out of sync with the type in one direction and the fixtures in the other. HEAD did not
typecheck until `4b06451`.

**Rule:** run deliberate breakage where the other session cannot see it. A detached worktree costs
one command — `git worktree add --detach <tmp> HEAD`, copy the files under test in, junction
`node_modules`, run `vitest` there — and the same technique already proved this session's tab work
green in isolation. Reserve in-tree injection for moments when the tree is provably yours, and
revert within the same tool call that injects. A transient error in a shared tree is not transient:
it is an open invitation to a concurrent agent that has no way to know it was staged.

Corollary for the reader on the other side: an error that appears in a file you are not working on,
for a symbol you have never heard of, is more likely someone else's experiment than a real gap.
Check `git diff` before filling it in.
## 2026-08-28 — Email clients cannot parse `oklch()` or `var()`, but the mirror must be mathematically provable

HTML email cannot consume CSS custom properties or modern color spaces (`oklch()`). The design system must provide a `#rrggbb` hex mirror for email templates and server settings (`src/lib/presentation/emailTokens.ts`). However, hand-written tables rot into divergent palettes.

**Rule:** compute the color conversion (OKLCH → OKLab → LMS → linear sRGB → gamma-corrected sRGB) inside static guard tests (`tests/unit/designSystemGuards.test.ts`) and assert that every token mirror entry matches `globals.css` `:root` computed hex values. Pin the mathematical converter against external ground truths (e.g. published sRGB primaries).

## 2026-08-28 — Environment-keyed dev bypasses in security gatekeepers create silent production holes

`getAdminActorOrThrow()` previously bypassed authentication when `NODE_ENV !== "production"`. Because Next.js Server Actions are public, network-reachable endpoints regardless of UI exposure, this allowed unauthenticated mutations on all dev, preview, staging, and CI deployments.

**Rule:** security gatekeepers must be invariant across all environments. Tests requiring administrative privileges must authenticate explicitly (e.g. via `signInAsAdmin()` setting test session cookies) rather than having production bypass branches embedded in runtime security code.

## 2026-08-28 — Accessible button states must match visual selection across dynamic routers

Interactive carousels and filter toggles (such as `PetChooserCarousel`) that allow users to select items or general funds must programmatically expose their active state to screen readers via boolean `aria-pressed` or `aria-selected` attributes, especially when preselected via URL search parameters.

**Rule:** visual active classes (`ring-2`, `bg-primary`, etc.) are invisible to assistive tech; component unit tests must assert `aria-pressed="true"` on the selected option and `aria-pressed="false"` on unselected options.

## 2026-08-28 — An import guard that reads specifiers does not care about `import type`

`tests/unit/layerBoundaries.test.ts` builds its graph with a regex over import *specifiers*. It
never parses the statement, so `import type { X } from "@/lib/server/y"` is an edge exactly like a
value import — and the boundary fails on it. That is correct: the guard is about the layer you are
coupled to, not the bytes that survive compilation. But it means the obvious way to keep two shapes
in sync — `ReturnType<typeof getServerFaqCategories>` in the client component — is closed, and the
error arrives at test time rather than from `tsc`.

**Rule:** when a "use client" module needs the *shape* of something a server module returns, declare
it structurally in `src/lib/presentation/` and let both sides satisfy it. Do not reach for
`import type` as a loophole; there isn't one. And before claiming a guard covers a case, inject the
violation and watch it go red — the type-only form was verified this way, not assumed.

## 2026-08-28 — The trap a brief warns you about can be wrong in the brief

`/fix-category-tabs` spent a numbered trap on the "all" tab: do not drop it, losing it is the
quietest way to break this. The same paragraph then gave one literal tab for both components —
`"All Topics"` / `"Semua Topik"` — and `RehabNeedsSection` actually said `"All Wishlist Items"` /
`"Semua Barangan Keperluan"`. Following the warning literally would have committed the exact silent
relabel it was written to prevent. The brief also framed the defect as dead tabs when the category
sets were already right and 7 of 9 *labels* had drifted.

**Rule:** a brief's warnings are claims about the tree, with the same status as its file paths — read
the values out of the source before trusting either. Being told where the trap is does not mean the
sentence naming it is accurate.

## 2026-08-28 — On this branch, a target doc goes stale in hours

`TARGET_PERSISTENCE_TARGETING.md` P-2 asked which of two things Tier 3 should be. The concurrent
session answered it — with `tests/integration/support/prismaDouble.ts`, splitting Tier 3a from
Tier 3b — before the ink was dry, and better than the framing in the target. The document had to be
corrected before anyone acted on it, or the next reader would have chased a decision already made.

**Rule:** re-run a target's own §1 / §3 claims against the tree immediately before starting work
from it, and again before writing "this is the only file" or any other exhaustiveness claim. Prefer
a measurement (`ls`, `grep -c`) over the reading you did an hour ago. Writing the conclusion down is
not the end of the job; keeping it true is part of it.

## 2026-08-28 — Ask which database a command resolves, before running it

`npm run db:push && npm run db:seed` looked like one operation against one database. It was two
operations against two, because the two halves loaded different env files:

- `prisma.config.ts` → `dotenv` on `.env.local` → a Neon branch marked `NEON_BRANCH=production`
- `prisma/seed.ts` → `import "dotenv/config"` → `.env` only, which this repo does not have → the
  hardcoded `localhost:5432` fallback

Both exit 0. The pair reads as an end-to-end verification while the halves have never met, and the
push half was mutating shared infrastructure.

**Rule:** before running any command that writes to a database, trace the env resolution for *that
specific command* and print the host it will hit. Never infer it from a sibling command in the same
npm chain. `dotenv` never overrides an already-set variable, so a shell-set `DATABASE_URL` is the
safe lever — it beats every env file without editing one.

**Corollary:** a destructive script (`deleteMany`, `TRUNCATE`, `db push`) that takes its target from
ambient configuration should refuse a non-local host and make the override explicit
(`ALLOW_REMOTE_SEED=true`). Configuration is not consent.

## 2026-08-28 — A test tier that can skip will eventually skip silently

`isLedgerPersistent()` reads `Boolean(process.env.DATABASE_URL)`, while `src/lib/server/prisma.ts`
invents a localhost URL when that variable is unset. A probe written to exercise Postgres therefore
takes the in-memory branch and passes — green, fast, having verified nothing. This is how "verified
against real Postgres" became a claim nobody had tested.

**Rule:** a tier whose whole purpose is to touch a real dependency must **fail** when the dependency
is absent, never skip. A skip renders as a pass in the summary line. Gate it out of the default test
command instead, so the everyday suite stays runnable without the dependency.

## 2026-08-28 — Verify against git before reporting data loss

Mid-task I reported that the other session had reverted `prisma/seed.ts` and destroyed its rehab and
history seeding. It had not. Its `npm install` was rewriting `package.json` in place, and file reads
during that window returned partial or stale content — including one snapshot with git conflict
markers that never existed on disk a second later.

**Rule:** before reporting that work was lost, confirm with `git diff HEAD -- <path>` and
`git show HEAD:<path> | grep -c <marker>`. A single read of a file in a repo with a concurrent writer
is a sample, not a fact. State the correction plainly and move on — see also
`docs/tasks/TARGET_PERSISTENCE_TARGETING.md` §8.

## 2026-08-28 — Critique the plan before executing it, even an approved one

The brief for this stream specified three things that did not exist or were unsafe: a
`recordDonationReceipt()` function (the export is `issueDonationReceipt()`), a §2 reference for
content living in §3 P-E, and a `db:push` step that would have written to production. Reading the
four named files first cost ten minutes and changed what the task *was*.

**Rule:** when handed a plan citing specific files, functions, and sections, verify each citation
against the tree before starting. Stale references are the normal case in a repo with an active
concurrent writer, not the exception.
