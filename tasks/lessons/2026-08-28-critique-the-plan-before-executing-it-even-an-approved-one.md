# Critique the plan before executing it, even an approved one

**Learned:** 2026-08-28

The brief for this stream specified three things that did not exist or were unsafe: a
`recordDonationReceipt()` function (the export is `issueDonationReceipt()`), a §2 reference for
content living in §3 P-E, and a `db:push` step that would have written to production. Reading the
four named files first cost ten minutes and changed what the task *was*.

**Rule:** when handed a plan citing specific files, functions, and sections, verify each citation
against the tree before starting. Stale references are the normal case in a repo with an active
concurrent writer, not the exception.
