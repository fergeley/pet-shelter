# Environment-keyed dev bypasses in security gatekeepers create silent production holes

**Learned:** 2026-08-28

`getAdminActorOrThrow()` previously bypassed authentication when `NODE_ENV !== "production"`. Because Next.js Server Actions are public, network-reachable endpoints regardless of UI exposure, this allowed unauthenticated mutations on all dev, preview, staging, and CI deployments.

**Rule:** security gatekeepers must be invariant across all environments. Tests requiring administrative privileges must authenticate explicitly (e.g. via `signInAsAdmin()` setting test session cookies) rather than having production bypass branches embedded in runtime security code.
