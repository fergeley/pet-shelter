# Domain lifecycle derivation beats static prose storage for temporal entities

**Learned:** 2026-08-28

Rescues rarely have birth certificates; intake forms routinely capture estimates like `"2 years"` or `"4 months"`. Storing that prose string directly in database columns (`Pet.age`, `Pet.ageCategory`) creates silent data rot: an animal admitted as `"young"` at `"2 years"` remains frozen in time years later, compromising adoption matching engines, medical alerts, and gallery filters.

**Rule:** decouple intake approximation from storage. Store canonical temporal anchors (`birthDate: String` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and `birthDateIsEstimate: Boolean`) at the persistence boundary. Derive human-readable strings (`"2 years"`, `"4 bulan"`) and lifecycle stages (`"puppy_kitten"`, `"young"`, `"adult"`, `"senior"`) dynamically in a pure domain calculation module (`src/lib/domain/petAge.ts`) at read time. Projection layers (`petMappers.ts`) can supply computed properties seamlessly without breaking client components.
