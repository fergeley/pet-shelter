# An import guard that reads specifiers does not care about `import type`

**Learned:** 2026-08-28

`tests/unit/layerBoundaries.test.ts` builds its graph with a regex over import *specifiers*. It
never parses the statement, so `import type { X } from "@/lib/server/y"` is an edge exactly like a
value import — and the boundary fails on it. That is correct: the guard is about the layer you are
coupled to, not the bytes that survive compilation. But it means the obvious way to keep two shapes
in sync — `ReturnType<typeof getServerFaqCategories>` in the client component — is closed, and the
error arrives at test time rather than from `tsc`.

**Rule:** when a "use client" module needs the *shape* of something a server module returns, declare
it structurally in `src/lib/presentation/` and let both sides satisfy it. Do not reach for
`import type` as a loophole; there isn't one. And before claiming a guard covers a case, inject the
violation and watch it go red — the type-only form was verified this way, not assumed.
