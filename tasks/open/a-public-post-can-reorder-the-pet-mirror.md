# A public POST can reorder the pet mirror, and one cache write reads that order

**Status:** open · opened 2026-09-22 · reasoned from the code during review, not reproduced

`findServerPetByIdAsync` rewrites the module-level mirror on every successful database read:

    serverPets = [pet, ...serverPets.filter((p) => p.id.toLowerCase() !== norm)];

`tasks/open/pet-profile-falls-back-to-a-fixture-the-database-lacks.md` already records that an
anonymous GET of a profile therefore mutates shared state, and calls it cosmetic. Two things make
it less so.

**It is now reachable by POST.** `submitApplication` resolves its target through that reader, so an
unauthenticated submission moves an animal to the head of the mirror — including a submission the
guard then *rejects*, because the reordering happens inside the read, before any check. The budget
is the submission rate limit (20 per 10 minutes per address, and the address budget only binds
where a trusted proxy header is configured at all), so the order is cheap to drive.

**One cache write depends on that order.** `markCachedPetAdopted` takes the first entry matching
**either** identifier:

    serverPets.find((p) => p.id === petId || p.name.toLowerCase() === petName.toLowerCase())

`atomicUpdateApplicationStatus` calls it when staff approve an application. Two shelter animals
sharing a name — not exotic; `pets.json` alone ships common ones — and whichever sits earlier in the
array wins, even when the *other* one is the exact id match. So an approval can flip the wrong
animal to Adopted in the cache until the next hydrate, and the attacker chooses which by submitting
an application for it first.

The forged-name half of this is already closed: `submitApplication` now stores `pet.name` from the
verified row rather than the posted string, so the name reaching `markCachedPetAdopted` is always
the real animal's. What remains is two real animals with the same real name, plus attacker-chosen
ordering.

Not fixed here for a reason worth stating: the repair belongs in `src/lib/server/petRepository.ts`
— prefer an exact id match before falling back to a name match, and/or do not rewrite the mirror
from a read — and a parallel session was editing that exact file for the fixture-fallback work
while this was found. Two branches rewriting one repository is how a clean per-path merge produces
a broken result.

**Settles when:** `markCachedPetAdopted` cannot return an animal whose id was not asked for while
an exact id match exists in the array — or the read stops reordering shared state — pinned by a
unit test holding two animals with the same name and asserting which one is marked.
